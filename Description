This project is yet another assignment from school where I had to create a simple simulation in order to dock two satellites. One of the satellites were in a state of rest 
whilst the other satellite were suppose to have a relative velocity of 2m/s or less, this can be controlled by the user increasing or decreasing the thrust. We ignored all other
external forces where only the propulsion force of the satellite is used to keep it simple. We used simple physics like Newtons laws in order to measure our calculations.
